
General Formulas to solve problems related to Arithmetic Progressions: If ‘a’ is the first term and ‘d’ is the common difference:

nth term of an AP = a + (n-1)*d.

Arithmetic Mean = Sum of all terms in the AP / Number of terms in the AP.

Sum of ‘n’ terms of an AP = 0.5 n (first term + last term) = 0.5 n [ 2a + (n-1) d ].
